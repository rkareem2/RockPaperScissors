In this text file I would analyze my logic that I would use to solve this problem
-Rock Paper Scissors is a game mostly played by two or more people, but here I would assume just 2, the user and computer
-So depending on what both players pick, whoever wins gets 2 points added until the game is over.
-The winning rules is as follows
    Winning Rules as follows:

    Rock vs paper-> paper wins
    Rock vs scissor-> Rock wins
    paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.
- The computer would get to choose randomly between 1,2,3 while user gets to pick any choice and depending on both outcome
  the winner is determined
