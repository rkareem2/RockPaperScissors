In this text file I would annalyze my logic that I would use to solve this problem
-Rock Paper Scissors is a game mostly played by two or more people, but here I would assume just 2, the user and computer
-So depending on what both players pick, whoever wins gets a point added until the game is over.
-So players would pick how many rounds they would like to play or whoever reaches a certain point first wins.
-The winning rules is as follows
    Winning Rules as follows:

    Rock vs paper-> paper wins
    Rock vs scissor-> Rock wins
    paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.
